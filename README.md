This study on the experienced of visually impaired people involved in the implementation of assistive technology through mobile phones. The algorithms was tested to existing datasets, enhanced and added trained datasets, discussed the results and their relevance, the analysis of the results, and highlight the implications of this study.

## Overview
This is an application for [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) on Android. It uses image classification to continuously classify objects it sees from the device's back camera. Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. The app classifies frames in real-time, displaying the top most probable classifications.
